- Name: Amazing and recommend for ambulatory wheelchair users too
  Review: |-
    Have been many times and always so impressed when return. The facilities and welcome and excellent. The new addition of sauna in the hills just took our experience up another level. Alex and Darren can't do enough to help and so accommodating. This was our first trip with one member of our group being an ambulatory wheelchair user. Alex and Darren were so helpful and ensured we had everything we needed and were very keen to make future changes to allow easier access. That said as an ambulatory wheelchair user, we would totally recommend In the Stix. Assistance is offered to get up the little slope at the entrance to the site. Honestly we had the best experience and no request for assistance was too little. We will definitely be back.

    My sister, niece, nephew and I had a lovely stay at In The Stix. The kitchen for the pod is so well equipped and we found the welcome so warm and friendly. Loved the personal touches, the large supply of wood for the fires (we used it for the hot tub, the pizza oven and the glamping pod fire!). I'd recommend starting the fire under the hot tub as soon as you arrive and keep a good eye on it - we were amazed how much the water retains heat so we could've used it the following day if we had had time.

    Absolutely gorgeous! One of the best glamping stays we've done. The bed is unbelievably comfy, the domes are immaculate and the site is beautiful. There is everything you could possibly need. Alex is an amazing host, friendly and down to earth without being imposing. The Plough in town does fabulous burgers, the Wheatsheaf does lovely food and a friendly atmosphere, both a 15 min walk. If you've got a designated driver the Grainstore in oakham which is a short drive (15 min) does a good selection of ales and a mean steak and ale pie. Rutland water is a good couple of days out with lots to deplore and do. All in all well worth a visit. Thanks Alex x

    We chose In The Stix to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary as we’d stayed in the domes before and knew it would be a great location. We had 100 guests, many of whom stayed on-site; either in the domes or camping in the additional field. From beginning to end we were looked after by the owners Alex & Darren who made sure we had an amazing weekend. We had caterers for the main meal and a bar for the evening, but In The Stix also provided delicious breakfast hampers and meal pots for anyone who needed it – so no-one went hungry! Alex organised everything for us including the caterers, the bar, the photographer and a licence for the event so that we could have music outside until late. We used many different parts of the site; the woods for our ceremony, the brook for cutting the cake and the event space for our food. The event space was used again on Sunday for homemade pizzas, and all those staying in the domes enjoyed a relaxing hot-tub. We had so much positive feedback from all our friends and family who all agreed it was the perfect weekend, and we now have so many happy memories to look back on – thank you In The Stix.

    Friendly and welcoming. A great place to relax and unwind without the fuss of organising all the camping gear. Great facilities, a beautiful area and lovely starry nights.

    We have just come back from a fabulous mid-week break at in the stix. The accommodation was lovely - it felt like the perfect introduction for my kids to camping, feelings simultaneously out-doorsy with all the joys of camping, without the need to cart all the gear all the way and with some luxuries that meant camping with kids still felt like a holiday! Alex & Duncan made us feel welcome and we’re really quick to help with anything we needed including refills of tin foil etc. All the essentials were included, and a generous amount of logs to keep all the fires burning all week. Couldn’t fault the experience one bit, and Rutland provided lots of nearby family friendly days out too (helped also by the Welcome Pack explaining what was nearby).

    We really enjoyed our stay at In The Stix. The Pods and facilities are excellent. The bathroom really exceeded our expectations and was as good as most hotel bathrooms, very impressed. The wood burning stove in the pods are a welcome addition and Jane's (site Manager) hand over was perfect, meaning we had no problems getting it lit. It really helps take the chill out of the air. We also made use of the wood burning oven and hot tub. You have to be patient when heating the hot tub, it can take up to 3 hours, but when it's up to temperature they really are great. The sight itself is really well laid out, with plenty of room between pods and the location is fab too. We made the most of the recommendations and went to 2 of the gastro pubs and made the most of the local attractions. Overall we had a fab time and wouldn't hesitate in recommending.

    Excellent accommodation in a uniquely designed Dome for relaxing and sleeping with lovely views over the countryside. The pod and the detached kitchen have all the facilities you need. There is just a ten minute walk to the nearest village and it is worth booking ahead if you want to dine at the Wheatsheaf that serves excellent food.

    We had this Glamping recommended to us by friends for a care free break from the world. It is a beautiful secluded venue. The glamping domes have everything you need with real beds and bedding, a comfortable bathroom and my daughter’s favourite the hanging globe chair. The outdoor kitchen we had provided an efficient simple stove and large cool box. The Kamado Egg bbq was excellent and we cooked every night. We opted to have the extra hot tub option and didn’t regret it, the tub is wood fired so you have to time heating it for use but once it’s warm it’s wonderful to sit and watch the sunset. We would definitely come back.
