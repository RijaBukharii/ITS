Intro Title: Locally sourced organic produce
Intro Description: Here in Rutland, we’re incredibly lucky to be surrounded by some
  of the finest organic produce, and we’re proud to feature it in our campsite breakfast
  hampers. We source our delicious bread, croissants, breakfast muffins and jams,
  from the renowned Hambleton Bakery. Our fresh meat, including free range eggs, sausages,
  bacon, and BBQ packs, comes from Farmer Lou—just a mile down the road—who also runs
  a fantastic farm shop for when you want to top up your hamper. For dairy, we turn
  to Ferneleys, located only five miles away, who supply us with fresh milk, creamy
  butter, and indulgent ice cream. To top it all off, we include freshly ground coffee
  from Two Chimps Coffee in Oakham, roasted to order for a perfect start to your morning.
  It’s all part of our commitment to supporting local producers and giving our guests
  a truly authentic Rutland experience.

BBQ Title: BBQ's
BBQ Description: Each of our domes is equipped with its own outdoor cooking setup,
  so you can embrace al fresco dining during your stay. Domes 1 to 4 feature our fantastic
  log-fired ovens — incredibly versatile, they allow you to cook pizzas directly on
  the hot stones for that authentic crispy base, or use the baking trays provided
  to whip up all kinds of delicious meals. Domes 5 and 6 come with our new ceramic
  eggs, a wonderful bit of kit that burns charcoal (supplied on site). Perfect for
  traditional BBQs, these ceramic eggs can also be used as an oven for slow-roasting,
  or fitted with a pizza stone so you can craft your own homemade pizza. Whatever
  you choose, you’ll have everything you need to cook up a memorable feast under the
  stars.
